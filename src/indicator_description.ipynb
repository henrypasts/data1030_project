    "I added standard tools from technical analysis that pull information from price. This work serves as 'feature engineering' to some extent but more research will be done on engineering features if model performance is not satisfactory. All feature 'windows', i.e. the lookback period were optimized by using the training data and finding the window values that best correlation to future price. Other features, such as the previous returns, are more relevant to percent change and may be dropped if better results come from predicting price and not the percent change of the next day's price.\n",
