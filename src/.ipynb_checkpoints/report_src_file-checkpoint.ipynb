Mathematicians and other people interested in stocks have formulated indicators that take in a certain period (data from x days ago) of the last day's price, open, low, high, volume, etc, in order to track and hopefully predict future price trends and momentums. The CMT has been criticized for putting too much emphasis on the predictive ability of indicators, which many skeptics have questioned. I think indicators are valuable, but I also agree that more emphasis needs to be put on prediction and testing predicitve power, thus I plan to incorporate machine learning algoritms to find patterns and increase prediction confidence of the technical indicators and to better bound probabilities.\n",

    "I added standard tools from technical analysis that pull information from price. This work serves as 'feature engineering' to some extent but more research will be done on engineering features if model performance is not satisfactory. All feature 'windows', i.e. the lookback period were optimized by using the training data and finding the window values that best correlation to future price. Other features, such as the previous returns, are more relevant to percent change and may be dropped if better results come from predicting price and not the percent change of the next day's price.\n",
